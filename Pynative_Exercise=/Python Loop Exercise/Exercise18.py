'''Practice Problem: 
The Collatz conjecture states that if you start with any positive integer n, 
and if n is even, divide it by 2; if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process. 
The sequence will always eventually reach 1. Write a program to print this sequence for a given number.'''

    if num % 2 == 0:
        num=num//2
    else:
        num=(num*3)+1
    print(f'{num}',end=' ')
